# Idea:
Play blackjack either against a dealer alone or with another person using websockets in C

# Needs:
## Card class?
- suit
- number
## Actions
- hit
- stand
## for poker:
- bet -> UI: % of pot?
- check
- fold

## Websocket implementation
- Pairing somehow, maybe websockets here would work if i want to play across different networks (ie. global multiplayer? but in that case i only know how regular ahh sockets work, is there a library for this?)
